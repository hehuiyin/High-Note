# High-Note

  Given the higher profitability of premium subscribers, it is generally in the interest of company to motivate users to go from “free to fee”; that is, convert free accounts to premium subscribers. The task in regards to this case is to analyze the data for potential insight to inform a “free-to-fee” strategy.

  Peer influence and user engagement can affect users’ decisions to pay for a premium subscription. Using the High Note data, we can predict the decision to buy using both types of variables. The results will quantify the effect of social engagement on revenue, as well as how valuable a premium subscriber can be in a freemium social community.
